<p id="specialstyle" style="max-width:70%; margin: auto; font-size:25Px"> My name is Michal Aloni and <b>I'm highly motivated to get into the QA field.</b><br><br> Over my 3.5 years as an HR coordinator (mainly in <b>HRIS</b> and learning area), I realized how much I love technology and systems, and I decided to study a field that better suits my personality.<br><br> <b>I pay attention to details, I have analytical and critical thinking, I'm punctual, thorough, orderly, and motivated to learn new fields and specialize in them.</b><br> Currently, I'm about to finish a manual QA course on behalf of the <b>"College of Automation".</b><br><br> On this site you can get a glimpse of one of the passions of my life â€“ <b>sports.</b><br> Since my childhood, <b>persistence, determination, precision</b> in exercises, <b>hard work, and motivation to constantly improve</b> have accompanied me to success in sports. They continue to accompany me in every field I deal with, and <b>I believe they will serve me well in QA as well.</b><br><br></p>

<p id="specialstyle" style="color:white; max-width:80%; margin: auto">When I was 6, I asked my mom to sign me up for gymnastics class so I could be like my sister. From here to there, I trained with this group for 8 years. Training was intense - 3 times a week, 3 hours each. <b>Persistence, hard work and precision in exercises were required to progress and improve.</b><br><br>Over the years, we have participated in many competitions across the country, and once we flew to London for training and meetings with other groups. <br>The decision to retire was not easy for me, and after a year I became a gymnastics guide for about 6 years. <b>There will always be a special place in my heart for the gymnastics world.</b><br><br></p>

<p id="specialstyle" style="color:white; max-width:80%; margin: auto">When I was 10, I was accepted to dance in the popular dance group in our regional council.<br>The group consists of boys and girls, and its dance styles are folklore, modern dance and couple dances. Besides its professional aspect, it had a large social aspect as well.<br>Throughout the years, we performed across the country, and once we flew to Brazil to perform and meet with other groups.<br><br> When I graduated from high school, my participation in the dance group also ended. <b>During these years I learned how far you can go with the help of learning, determination and willpower.</b> <br><br></p>

<p id="specialstyle" style="color:white; max-width:80%; margin: auto">My first exposure to group training was 4 years ago. From then until today, I've worked out 3-4 times a week, in a variety of types of training: CrossFit, functional training, strength training, yoga, Pilates, etc. One of my favorite workout types is functional training, in which exercises are combined with different types of equipment. <br><br> Exercising makes me feel alive. <b>I enjoy learning new exercises and working hard to get better and stronger.</b> Gymnastics and dance have provided me with the strength and precision in movement needed for the training, as well as <b>the persistence and the ability to work hard.</b> <br><br></p>
