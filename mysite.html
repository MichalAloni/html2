<p id="specialstyle" style="color:white; max-width:95%; margin: auto">When I was 6, I asked my mom to sign me up for gymnastics class so I could be like my sister. From here to there, I trained with this group for eight years. Training was intense - three times a week, three hours each.<br>Our group has participated in many competitions across the country over the years, and once we flew to London for training and meetings with other groups. Several of my friends were in this group with me, but they retired over time.<br>I decided to quit after eight years, and it was a very difficult decision. One year later, I became a gymnastics guide, and I worked there for about six years. I can say that there will always be a special place in my heart for the gymnastics world. <br><br></p>

<p id="specialstyle" style="color:white; max-width:95%; margin: auto">When I was 10, I wanted to join the popular dance group in our regional council (starts in 4th grade and ends in 12th grade). After passing the group exams, I joined the group with a lot of my friends.<br>Couple dance was an important part of the dance group that combines modern and folklore dance. It was a mixed group of boys and girls, and besides its professional aspect, it had a large social aspect as well.<br> We trained three times a week for 1.5 hours each time. Throughout the years, we performed across the country, and in the last year (12th grade), we flew to Brazil to perform and meet with other groups. This part of my life was enjoyable for me - I have a lot of experience from these years with my friends in the group. <br><br></p>

<h1 id="specialstyle2"> <span style="color:white">Group Workouts</span><br></h1>
<p id="specialstyle" style="color:white; max-width:95%; margin: auto">My first exposure to group training was four years ago. From then until today, I've worked out in a variety of types of training: CrossFit, functional training, strength training, yoga, Pilates, etc. During the week, I workout 3-4 times and try to combine two types of training. I enjoy exercising because it makes me feel alive and strong. I enjoy learning new exercises as well as feeling stronger and better with those I am familiar with.<br> One of my favorite workout types is functional training, in which exercises are combined with different types of equipment. Gymnastics and dancing have definitely provided me with the strength and flexibility I need for this kind of training. <br><br></p>
